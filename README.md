## Welcome to our photos website

### Please [click this link](https://ondrejvalla.github.io/z-o-photo-album/index.html) if you like to see the live website.


#### This website was created as my Second Milestone project with Code Institute. 
As mentioned in the intro of the landing page, my wife Zuzana and I enjoy going on holiday. However as there are restrictions for traveling at the moment (year 2021) our way to get to the holiday mood again is by looking at our holiday pictures and then enjoy the sunshine in the garden. We always go through folders on our computer. Zuzana was suggesting many times, that it would be great to have one gallery page. That is why I decided to create this website as my MS2 project.

## Overview

Even though it is very likely, that the main two users of this website will be Zuzana and myself, other users can still find some features and interactivity like changing color buttons, gallery buttons, show/hide buttons, social links and contact page to get in touch or to send us some destinations suggestion.
